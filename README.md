- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really have little to say here, and honestly, that goes for the whole project.
I mostly did it just to test things out.

However, I *did* discover the existence of the `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` elements.
I actually wanted to use them for the preparation time block, but I couldnâ€™t get the design I wanted,  
so I gave up on that idea and went simpler instead.

## Acknowledgments

Donâ€™t overthink it. I probably did too much (and not enough, ironically) for a challenge like this.
Donâ€™t hesitate to use the internet as your ally ðŸ‘Œ Stack Overflow has every answer youâ€™ll ever need.
Start by following your gut, then circle back and ask yourself : how can I make this simpler or better?
And if you donâ€™t know, ask the internet. gl!
